# E-Waste Inventory Management System

> A scalable, role-based web application for tracking, categorizing, and reporting electronic waste components.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The E-Waste Inventory Management System provides administrators and contributors with intuitive dashboards to manage and categorize a wide range of electronic components (e.g., capacitors by capacitance, transistors by type). Built on Next.js with server-side Actions powering all API routes, and MongoDB as the data store, the system delivers:

- **Inventory Tracking & Categorization**  
  Fine-grained classification of e-waste items (e.g., 10 µF capacitors, NPN/PNP transistors)  
- **Role-Based Dashboards**  
  Separate interfaces for **Admin** (full CRUD & reporting) and **Contributor** (data entry & updates)  
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**  
  Charts and tables powered by Shadcn UI components for real-time insights  

> **Shout-out:** A special thanks to **Pasindu** for the outstanding UI/UX designs in Figma that shaped the look and feel of this application. 🎨
